# Front-End Starter Template

An HTML 5 Starter template by [Mitchell Thorson](http://mitchellryanthorson.com) for quick-starting simple front-end web projects.
There are a million good options out there for starter-templates, but I found myself repeating steps to get up and running and decided to make my own starter repo.

##Version 0.1
There are quite a few things I'd like to add to this as I go, but this is a start.

## Getting Started
First, you'll need:
* Ruby
* Compass ('gem install compass')
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* Grunt.js ('gem install -g grunt-cli')

Then:
run 'npm install' from root directory and you're set.

## Compiling SCSS and JS Files
Run 'grunt' for one-time compiling or 'grunt watch' to watch changes.
